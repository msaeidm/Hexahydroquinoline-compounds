# Toxoplasma Gondii Inhibitory Activity of 5-Oxo-Hexahydroquinoline Derivatives

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our study evaluating the anti-Toxoplasma gondii activity of 5‑oxo‑hexahydroquinoline derivatives (compounds Z1–Z4). Our work comprises several key steps:

1. **Chemical Synthesis Analysis:**  
   Process and summarize experimental characterization data (NMR, MS, IR) for the synthesized compounds.

2. **In Vitro Bioactivity Assays:**  
   Analyze flow cytometry data to assess the mortality (%) of T. gondii tachyzoites after treatment with the compounds.

3. **In Vivo Evaluations:**  
   Analyze mice survival data (mean longevity) after treatment with selected compounds.

4. **Molecular Docking:**  
   Parse and visualize docking results of the compounds with the target enzyme (ENR) using AutoDock Vina outputs.
